Hi! My name is Francois and I am a Master's student at HEC Montreal. When I'm not studying, you are likely to find me in the kitchen or at the gym!

In this blog, I will mostly detail my journey to become a machine learning developper. 

A little bit of backstory:

I graduated university with a bachelor's in business administration and a certificate in computer science. I felt like I had still much more to learn, so I pursued my studies at HEC Montreal. There, I was able to find something I was truly passionate about, but I felt like I missed quite a bit of knowledge to fully understand the concepts. 

This leads me to my project, which is to self learn computer science, mathematics and algortihms. My curriculum is loosely based on the OSSU curriculum [available here](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/curriculum) and the guide by Oz Nova and Myles Byrner [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com). Obviously, I will be putting more emphasis on mahetmatics and statistics. 

I invite you to visite my [Github](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/cscurriculum) for my exercises solutions.
