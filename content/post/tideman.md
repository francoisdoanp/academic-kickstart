After 2 months, I was finally able to resume week 3 of CS50. My semester ended up being quite busy, but very much rewarding.

CS50's problem sets were, thus far, relatively easy for me. But then, I was presented with the Tideman problem. Now, there are multiple ways to solve the problem, but I was determined to use recursion. You see, recursion was something I had learned while completing my certificate in computer science. I say learned, but truthfully, I never fully grasped the concept, and I suppose I was able to get through without a true understanding.

Well, Tideman took a whole week to complete, which would be around 30 hours. These hours include long detours, which led me to reconsider what recursion was and practice on multiple exercises. Overall, I am very pleased with the level of challenge this problem posed. Drawing (or rather, scribbling) was absolutely necessary to solidify my understanding.

A special thanks to Reddit user [michael0x2a](https://www.reddit.com/user/michael0x2a/) for his [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8m812d/i_dont_know_how_to_learn_recursion_is_it/dzm3x6o/?context=8&depth=9) that really helped me grasp the concept more clearly. Doing all the [exercises](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1) in Java on [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com) afterwards definitely solidified my understanding. 

My solution to the problem is available [here](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/cscurriculum/blob/master/CS50/Problem%20Set%203/tideman.c).

The time spent on Tideman cut the hours I had planned for MIT6042. Squeezing in more hours allowed me to finish lecture 1 and 2, as well as recitation 1, which was a lot of fun. However, I am realizing that my math level is quite low. Therefore, I modified my curriculum to add more math classes, which I think will prepare me better for machine learning.

Keep on learning  
Francois
